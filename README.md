Getting Started with Create React App With Redux
Redux Setup
To add Redux to your project, follow these steps:

Install Redux and React-Redux:
bash
Copy code
npm install redux react-redux
Create a Redux store:
Create your reducers and combine them into a root reducer.
Use the createStore function from Redux to create the store.
Export the store and wrap your application with the Provider component from React-Redux.
Create actions and action creators:
Define action types for your actions.
Create action creator functions that return actions.
Use Redux in your components:
Use the useSelector hook to access the state.
Use the useDispatch hook to dispatch actions.
Redux Persist Setup
To persist your Redux state across page refreshes, you can use Redux Persist. Follow these steps to set it up:

Install Redux Persist:
bash
Copy code
npm install redux-persist
Create a Redux Persist configuration:
Define a configuration object that specifies which parts of your state to persist and where to persist them (e.g., localStorage or sessionStorage).
Update your root reducer:
Use the persistReducer function from Redux Persist to wrap your root reducer with the persist configuration.
Create the Redux store with Redux Persist:
Use the persistStore function from Redux Persist to create a persistor.
Export both the store and persistor.
Wrap your application with the PersistGate component:
Use the PersistGate component from Redux Persist to ensure that your application waits for the state to be rehydrated before rendering.
